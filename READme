**** Landing page******
* utilized markup with react framework
* Was only able to use make the skeleton
* Divided features within different components for conventional purposes
* Potentially wanted to make it responsive for tablet and mobile 
* For the carousel section image I was going to use slick carousel since the plugin is light and conatins features that could be useful for how we want to present it.
* wanted to add accessibility.
*in this typical situation I would work with the designers are go over how things execute for user cases.
